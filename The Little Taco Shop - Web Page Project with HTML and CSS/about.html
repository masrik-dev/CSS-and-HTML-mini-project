                    <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States of America?</summary>
                    <p class="about__trivia-answer">
                        Jeffrey M. Pilcher, taco historian and professor of the history at the University of Minnesota. says the earliest mention of tacos in the United States are in a newspaper from <time datetime="1905">1905</time>. That's a time when Mexican migrants are starting to comeâ€”working the mines and railroads and other such jobs. In the United States, Mexican food was seen as street food, lower-class food. It was associated with a group of women called the Chili Queens and with tamale pushcarts in Los Angeles. The Chili Queens of San Antonio were street vendors who earned a little extra money by selling food during festivals. When tourists started arriving in the 1880s with the railroad, these occasional sales started to become a nightly event. Tourists came looking for two things in San Antonioâ€”the Alamo and the Chili Queens.
